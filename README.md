# chinotype
General purpose script for looking for over and under represented EHR facts in an i2b2 patient-set. Can be used for finding adverse drug reactions, off-label uses, healthcare outcomes disparities, comorbidities, and who knows what else. The name is a portmanteau of Chi-squared and phenotype.

Also includes a web plugin to call the script from i2b2.
