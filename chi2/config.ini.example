; are drug categories (yours is likely different). In UTHSCSA's i2b2, 
; procedure branch nodes have paths that end in '\A________\' whereas leaf 
; nodes lack the leading 'A'. Your site is likely different.

; SQL snippet that applies to further limit all the above results, probably not 
; very site-specific. The c_totalnum restriction is to avoid the long tail of 
; branch nodes too sparsely populated to be meaningfully interpreted anyway. 
; The c_visualattributes explicitly filters for branch nodes (active, hidden,
